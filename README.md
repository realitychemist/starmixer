# Star Mixer
***Random generation of plausible star systems***

This is extremely early version software.  The goal of this software is to be able to easily generate star systems using a plausible approximation of physical reality.

## (Planned) Features
### Random Generation
Quickly generate a completely unique star system in a way that respects plausibility.  No stars will have planets inside the Roche limit (and likewise for planets and their moons), and most stars will be fairly small.  Of course, some assumptions need to be made about some statistical distributions, but as far as possible random generation will be based on a plausible guess about the makeup of the actual universe.

### Guided Generation
Maybe you don't want to randomly generate a star system that is likely to be typical!  Maybe you would prefer to generate systems that contain likely-habitable planets.  Maybe you want a system that has planets orbiting around a black hole.  Whatever cool sci-fi story you have planned, guided generation will help you create systems that fit your constraints but remain plausible in other ways.

### System Tweaks
Did you generate a really cool system, but think it would be *even cooler* if...  Well, system tweaks will let you adjust parameters of your generated star system on the fly, maintaining plausibility by adjusting other parameters of the system to match (unless you'd rather it didn't).

### Export Systems
What good is it to generate a super cool system if it's gone the next time you come back?  Export will let you export your system as a logically-formatted XML file, ready to pass into another application or to re-upload to Star Mixer to view in the future.
